# Hey, I'm SRJ! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub playground, where code meets creativity, and every bug is just a puzzle waiting to be solved! 🧩✨

## Who Am I?

I'm SRJ, your friendly Full Stack Developer. I juggle languages and tools like a circus performer, taking on challenges like Python automations, building IoT projects, and everything in between. Whether it's fixing bugs or learning new tricks, I’m all in! 💻

## What I Do

### Full Stack Sorcery 🧙‍♂️
From backend spells to frontend enchantments, I've got the full stack on lock. If it involves code, consider me obsessed.

### Languages I Speak
- **C/C++**: For when I want to feel like a tech wizard.
- **Python**: The go-to language for automating my world and wrangling data like a pro.
- **HTML, JS, CSS**: The dynamic trio for crafting visually stunning and functional web experiences.
- **Dart**: Flutter's partner in crime. Who doesn't want mobile apps that glide like a dream?
- **SQL**: Making data dance to my tune.
- **PHP**: Because every server-side problem needs a quick fix!

### Tools I Can't Live Without
- **Arduino**: Making LEDs blink, sensors beep, and IoT dreams come true.
- **Flutter**: Crafting mobile apps so smooth they should come with a warning label.
- **Firebase**: Real-time databases that just feel like magic.
- **Git**: Keeping my code organized and my sanity intact (most of the time).
- **ESP**: Wi-Fi for IoT, because why not make everything a bit smarter?
- **Linux**: The hacker vibe without the black hoodie.
- **MySQL**: The database I can rely on, even if my queries sometimes cause a few tears.
- **CyberSec**: Keeping things secure because vulnerabilities are not my vibe.
- **Android**: Bringing Android apps to life with some serious coding mojo.
- **WEB Apps**: Building the web, one quirky, awesome app at a time.

## My Superpowers

- **Python Automations**: I automate the boring stuff so we can focus on the fun stuff!
- **IoT Projects**: Turning regular gadgets into IoT superheroes.
- **Tech Enthusiast**: If there's a field in tech, I’ve probably dabbled in it – or I will soon.
- **Problem Solving**: Every problem is just a challenge in disguise, and I love cracking the code.
- **Learning Addict**: Give me a new skill to learn, and I'll dive in headfirst!
