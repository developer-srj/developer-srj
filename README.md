# Yo, I’m ***SRJ!*** 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub grind – where ideas click, tech vibes strong, and every bug’s just a feature waiting to pop. I’m all about taking code, hardware, and crazy ideas and mashing them into something legit.  

## Who Am I?  

I’m SRJ, your go-to **Full-Stack IoT Developer** and the guy who makes hardware talk, apps respond, and data flow. I’m not just building IoT systems; I’m making gadgets smarter, apps faster, and tech cooler. Outside IoT? Catch me diving into automations, CAD tinkering, or solving weird bugs like it’s a mini escape room.  

If it’s got circuits, APIs, or scripts, I’ve probably broken and rebuilt it.  

## What I Do  

### **IoT Badassery** 🌐  
IoT is where I shine – turning regular gadgets into next-gen connected beasts.  
- **End-to-end builds**: Sensors, firmware, dashboards, and cloud hookups – done and dusted.  
- Writing firmware that makes devices hum like a well-oiled machine.  
- Crafting mobile apps and web interfaces that don’t just look dope but work smoothly.  
- Tying it all together with APIs, databases, and some backend magic.  

If it sends data, automates, or looks remotely “smart,” I’m your guy.  

### Full-Stack Vibes 🔥  
From sleek frontends to solid backends, I make systems work harder so users don’t have to.  
- **Frontend**: Responsive, functional UIs that don’t suck.  
- **Backend**: Scalable APIs and server-side code to handle the heavy lifting.  
- **Databases**: Structured, optimized, and zero chaos.  

### My Coding Arsenal  
- **C/C++**: When it’s time to get hardcore with hardware.  
- **Python**: For automations, backend wrangling, and general wizardry.  
- **HTML, CSS, JS**: Crafting frontend gold from scratch.  
- **Dart**: Flutter FTW – mobile apps that just glide.  
- **SQL**: Making data behave like it’s supposed to.  
- **PHP**: The OG server-side hack for quick backend fixes.  

## My Tech Stack 🛠️  

### IoT & Hardware  
- **Arduino IDE & ESP-IDF**: Crafting firmware that runs the show, whether it’s prototyping or production-ready code.  
- **Microcontrollers**: From 8-bit classics to 32-bit beasts – if it processes, I program it.  
- **Sensors & Actuators**: Making devices sense the world and interact back like pros.  
- **Wireless Communication**: Modules chatting away using LoRa, nRF, Wi-Fi, BLE, Internet and more – because IoT without comms is just... "things."  
- **Servers & Dashboards**: Setting up systems to log, control, and monitor the IoT gossip in real time.  

### Mechanical Design  
- **3D CAD (FreeCAD)**: From enclosures to full-blown mechanical setups – I’ve got it covered.  

### Web & Software  
- **Flutter**: Smooth, snappy mobile apps that do the job right.  
- **Firebase**: Because real-time updates are life.  
- **REST APIs**: Bridging devices, apps, and the cloud like a pro.
- **MySQL**: Querying, managing, and structuring databases like a pro – the backbone for storing IoT and app data.  
- **AsyncWebServer**: Light, fast, and perfect for microcontroller web servers.  

### Dev Tools  
- **VS Code**: My Swiss army knife, tricked out with all the best extensions.  
- **Git**: Keeping my code legit and collabs seamless.  

### Cyber Security  
- **Linux (Parrot, Kali)**: The hacker's playground – for tweaking, breaking, and securing systems like a pro (not for hacking your GF's accounts, though 🤨).  
- **CyberSec**: Pen-testing, vulnerability hunting, and locking systems down tight like a boss.  


### Bonus Skills  
- **MS Office (Excel)**: Turning raw data into charts that slap.  
- **WEB Hosting (cPanel, hPanel)**: From setting up domains to managing databases, all day, every day.  
- **WEB Apps**: Functional and sleek apps that just work.  

## My Superpowers 💥  
- **Python Automations**: Automating the boring junk so we can party with the fun stuff 🎉.  
- **IoT Projects**: Turning dumb devices into IoT MVPs 🦸‍♂️.  
- **Tech Junkie**: Tried it? Probably. Trying it soon? Absolutely.  
- **Bug Busting**: Solving code puzzles like it’s my side gig.  
- **Skill Grinding**: If it’s tech, I’m learning it. Period.  
- **Search King**: Finding answers faster than you can Google “how to fix…” 🔍.  
- **AI Mastery**: Leveraging AI to work smarter, not harder.  



**Code isn’t just lines; it’s what brings ideas to life.** Let’s make it happen. 🚀
